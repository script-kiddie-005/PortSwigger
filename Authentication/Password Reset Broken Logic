# Password Reset Broken Logic

## Overview:
This repository documents the PortSwigger Web Security Academy authentication lab "Password Reset Broken Logic".  
The lab demonstrates how flawed business logic in password reset functionality can allow attackers to "reset arbitrary user passwords without proper verification", leading to full account takeover.


## Lab Objective:
Exploit weaknesses in the password reset workflow to gain unauthorized access to a victim account by abusing broken validation logic.

## Vulnerability Type:
- Authentication Logic Flaw
- Broken Password Reset Mechanism
- Account Takeover (ATO)

  OWASP Category:
- OWASP Top 10 – Broken Authentication

## Tools Used:
- Burp Suite (Proxy + Repeater)
- Web Browser
- Manual Request Manipulation

## Attack Summary:
The application implements a password reset feature that:
- Generates reset functionality without properly binding it to a specific user
- Fails to validate ownership of the reset request
- Allows manipulation of parameters to reset another user’s password

By intercepting and modifying the reset flow, an attacker can:
1. Trigger a password reset
2. Modify user-identifying parameters (token)
3. Set a new password for a victim account
4. Authenticate as the victim

## Exploitation Steps:
1. Initiate the password reset process
2. Intercept the reset request using Burp Suite
3. Identify user-controllable parameters
4. Modify logic-dependent values (token)
5. Submit manipulated request
6. Log in using the newly set password

## Impact:
- Full account compromise
- Unauthorized access to sensitive data
- Potential lateral movement depending on privileges
- High business risk due to logic abuse

## Severity: High

## Remediation
- Bind password reset tokens strictly to a specific user
- Enforce server-side validation of reset requests
- Use single-use, time-bound reset tokens
- Do not rely on client-controlled parameters for identity
- Implement robust logging and alerting for reset attempts

## Learning Outcome
- Understand how authentication logic flaws occur
- Learn why business logic vulnerabilities are hard to detect
- Develop a mindset for testing workflows, not just endpoints
