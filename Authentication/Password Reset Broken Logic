## Objective:
The objective of this lab was to analyze and exploit flaws in the password reset functionality caused by broken authentication logic, ultimately leading to unauthorized account access.
The focus was on identifying logic-level weaknesses.

## Approach:
- Analyzed the password reset workflow end-to-end
- Intercepted password reset requests using an interception proxy
- Identified parameters responsible for user identification
- Manipulated logic-dependent values to bypass intended validation
- Tested whether password reset actions were properly bound to the requesting user


## Key Findings:
- The password reset mechanism failed to correctly associate reset actions with a specific user
- User-controlled parameters could be manipulated to target other accounts
- No effective server-side validation was enforced during the reset process
- This flaw allowed password reset for arbitrary users

## Tools & Environment
- Burp Suite (Proxy, Repeater)
- Web Browser

## 5. Outcome
- Successfully reset the victim user’s password without authorization
- Gained full access to the target account
- Demonstrated a complete account takeover scenario due to logic abuse

## 6. Learning Takeaways
- Authentication workflows must be tested as complete processes, not isolated endpoints
- Business logic vulnerabilities can be more dangerous than technical flaws
- Server-side validation is critical for authentication-related functionality
- Password reset features are high-risk and require strict security controls
