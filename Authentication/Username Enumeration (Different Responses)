## Objective
- To analyze the authentication flow of the target application, identify weaknesses in credential handling, and successfully bypass authentication controls to gain unauthorized access.

## Approach:

- Analyzed the login functionality to understand request and response behavior.
- Tested authentication parameters for common weaknesses such as predictable credentials and improper validation.
- Leveraged manual testing techniques to confirm exploitability rather than relying solely on automated tools.
- Validated successful authentication bypass through controlled interaction with the application.

## Key Findings:

- The application failed to properly enforce secure authentication checks.
- Inadequate handling of authentication logic allowed unauthorized access.
- The vulnerability highlights the importance of robust credential validation and secure authentication workflows.

## Tools & Environment:

- Burp Suite (manual request analysis and interception)
- Web browser (application interaction)
- Linux-based testing environment

## Outcome:

- The authentication weakness was successfully identified and exploited, resulting in unauthorized access to the application.
- This lab reinforces the impact of weak authentication controls and the necessity of secure design practices.

## Learning Takeaways

- Authentication mechanisms are a critical attack surface in web applications.
- Manual analysis is essential for understanding logic flaws beyond automated scanning.
- Even simple authentication weaknesses can lead to complete compromise.
