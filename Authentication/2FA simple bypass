## Objective
The objective of this lab was to identify and exploit weaknesses in the two-factor authentication (2FA) implementation, specifically focusing on logic flaws that allow authentication bypass without completing the second factor verification.

## Approach
- Analyzed the multi-step authentication workflow involving username, password, and 2FA
- Observed how authentication state was managed across requests
- Intercepted and manipulated requests during the login process
- Tested whether access to authenticated resources was possible without completing the 2FA step
- Validated whether server-side enforcement of 2FA was consistently applied

## Key Findings
- The application did not strictly enforce completion of the 2FA step before granting access
- Authentication state could be reused or bypassed by directly accessing protected endpoints
- The 2FA mechanism was implemented as a workflow step rather than a mandatory security control
- This resulted in a complete bypass of the second authentication factor

## Tools & Environment
- Burp Suite (Proxy)
- Web Browser

## Outcome
- Successfully bypassed the 2FA verification step
- Gained authenticated access using only valid username and password
- Demonstrated that the 2FA control was ineffective due to broken authentication logic

## Learning Takeaways
- 2FA must be enforced server-side and tied strictly to session state
- Implementing 2FA as a UI step rather than a security requirement leads to bypass risks
- Authentication workflows should be tested as a whole, not as isolated steps
- A weak 2FA implementation can provide a false sense of security while offering no real protection
